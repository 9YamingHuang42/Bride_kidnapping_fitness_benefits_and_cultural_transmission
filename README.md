# Bride_kidnapping_fitness_benefits_and_cultural_transmission
To understand the persistence of bride kidnapping, we first focus on the fitness benefits by exploring the effects of kidnap marriage on age at first marriage, fertility and social standing, and then the inter-and intra-generational transmission of this practice by exploring the effects of parental, older brothers' and older sisters' marriage types. We also examine the effects of the number of brothers and the number of sisters to further confirm the intra-generational pathway.
